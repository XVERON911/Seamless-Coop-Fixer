Fix for older elden ring game versions running with seamless coop.
This fix contains seamless coop & game injections as it will need to run on all machines needed to connect multiplayer.

this fix also contains a memory injection trainer which is not recommended for use as the game has an internal anti-cheat systems which can cause crashes at sometimes.

!!! I have no permissions from the owner of seamless coop to edit or reverse engineer his mods and this fix is only manipulating internal game files to run seamless coop mod without issues
(it DO NOT cause any errors in the game as this fix reverses back everything upon game close) !!!
